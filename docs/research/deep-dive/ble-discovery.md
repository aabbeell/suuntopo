# Deep dive: ble-discovery (verified)

## Conclusion
Two of the three load-bearing claims hold against primary sources. The third is narrower than the report says, and the report missed two problems.

**Held (confirmed from source):**
- **Bosch bridge on a Race S.** While serving the watch, the ESP32 advertises flags plus AD 0x07 with the LDI UUID. Its name sits in the scan response, and it never sends AD 0x06. The watch app's [7,uuid]+[6,uuid] (17-element arrays) connected on the author's Race S (forum 15217 #0).
- **SensorPush HT.w.** The passive-scan fixtures in sensorpush-ble PR #19 only work if the 128-bit UUID is in the advertising packet and the name is not.
- **Ruuvi.** Firmware 3.34.1 puts 0x0499 manufacturer data in a connectable, scannable advertising packet. The name and the Nordic UART Service (NUS) UUID go only in the scan response.
- **FORM.** A [255,125,6] filter connects on a Vertical 2, not a Race S.

**[corrected] The Nuki failure is not evidence about filters.** The app eagerly loaded a 26.7 KB crypto module in onLoad from commit e7da13d on, before all three hardware tests. A third filter, [8,'Nuki'], also failed. The author's final commit concludes that connect() probably never ran.

**[corrected] "sp1 and sp2 are OR alternatives" is not established.** Bosch rules out strict per-type AND and nothing more. Every observed success is equally consistent with the watch ignoring sp2 entirely.

**[corrected] The Ruuvi recommendation breaks the report's own rule.** It pairs the Ruuvi-specific sp1 with the generic NUS UUID as sp2.

Confidence: confirmed for what each device advertises, inferred for how the two parameters combine and what the matching semantics are. Hardware tests can settle both.

## Design rules
- Pass each search parameter as a plain JS Array of integers 0-255: one AD-type byte followed by at most 16 value bytes. 17 elements is the vendor template's own shape and works on a Race S (Bosch). Arrays built at runtime are fine. Strings and Uint8Array are untested: do not use them.
- Put the filter most likely to match in sp1. Until a test proves the watch reads sp2 at all, treat sp2 as a possibly ignored extra, never as the only path to a match (Tymewear's sp2 'backup' and its unreachable UUID fallback are the anti-pattern).
- Make sp1 and sp2 equally specific, because under the probable OR semantics the broader one decides which device gets connected. Concretely: no generic Nordic UART Service (NUS) UUID next to a Ruuvi company-ID filter, no [0x16,0x1A,0x18] or [0x16,0x95,0xFE] next to an exact name, and no [3,0xE0,0xFF] next to an UltraBip name.
- For 128-bit UUIDs send [7,uuidLE16] and [6,uuidLE16]; for 16-bit UUIDs send [3,lo,hi] and [2,lo,hi]. After T0 shows which AD type the device actually uses, put that one in sp1.
- Until active scanning is proven on a Race S, a filter that matches only in the scan response must not be the app's sole discovery path. In the advertising packet: the SensorPush service UUID and the Ruuvi 0x0499 manufacturer data. In the scan response only: the Ruuvi name and NUS, the SensorPush name, the pvvx ATC_ name, and the Bosch-bridge name.
- Until prefix matching is proven, name filters carry the complete advertised name, encoded as UTF-8 bytes (not charCodeAt&0xFF). Get it from a per-device setting; for sideloaded tests put it in data.json.
- Manufacturer-data filters begin with the little-endian company ID (Ruuvi 0x99,0x04; FORM 0x7D,0x06). Do not rely on bytes after the company ID being matched until T1 V2/V4 proves it. Avoid beacon-only payloads as a general caution. The Nuki case is not evidence for or against this.
- Never derive a SensorPush characteristic UUID from the service UUID. The service ends in ...0AB0 but every characteristic ends in ...0AA9. The 128-bit filter applies only to 2nd-gen units (HT.w / HTP.xw), not the HT1.
- Ruuvi: connectability is decided at firmware build time (APP_GATT_ENABLED). Before writing tag-specific code, confirm in nRF Connect that the tag connects and lists NUS. Enable NUS TX notifications within 12 s of event 100, or production firmware reboots the tag.
- Keep onLoad small and lazy-load large ext files with evalFile right before first use. A failed or out-of-memory onLoad means connect() is never called, and the watch then shows the same 'Cannot find device' Searching view as a filter miss. Log a 'connect called' systemEvent so the two can be told apart.
- There is no device picker: the first matching device wins. Show identity on screen (SensorPush LED blink via EF09000C-...-0AA9, Ruuvi MAC from the DF5 payload, vario battery). Phone apps and gateways must release the device first: a connected Ruuvi stops advertising as connectable.
- Discovery cannot be tested in the simulator: every appConn method there is an empty no-op, so connect returns undefined and no events fire.

## Hardware tests
- T0, advertising capture with pre-checks (Android HCI snoop log + Wireshark, or macOS PacketLogger; not nRF Connect's merged view). Record each AD structure separately for ADV_IND and SCAN_RSP, plus the advertising event type. Expected: SensorPush puts the ef090000-...-0ab0 UUID in ADV_IND as AD 0x06 or 0x07 and the name 'SensorPush HT.w XXXX' in SCAN_RSP. Ruuvi puts flags + FF 99 04 05 ... in ADV_IND (connectable) and 'Ruuvi XXXX' + NUS in SCAN_RSP. pvvx puts Service Data in ADV_IND and the name in SCAN_RSP. The UltraBip layout is unknown, which is what T0 settles. Pre-checks in the same session: the SensorPush is an HT.w, not an HT1 advertising ...0aa9; nRF Connect can connect to the Ruuvi and lists NUS (if it cannot, the tag's firmware has GATT disabled and no appConn filter will ever work).
- T1, matching rules with a controlled advertiser (nRF Connect for Android, Advertiser tab, connectable legacy advertising). Use one .dev that logs systemEvent on every event plus a 'connect called' marker, and steps a variant index kept in localStorage on each onLoad. Config A: ADV = flags + 16-bit UUID 0xFFF5 (complete list) + manufacturer data FF FF 01 02 03 04 05 06 + 128-bit UUID U; SCAN_RSP = complete local name SPTEST01. Single-parameter variants: V1 [3,0xF5,0xFF] (event 100 means 16-bit filters work); V2 [255,0xFF,0xFF] and V4 [255,0xFF,0xFF,1,2,3,4,5,6] (both connect: prefix or full match); V3 [255,0x03,0x04] (connects: contains matching); V5 [9,'SPTEST01'] (connects on A: active scanning, provided name matching works); V6 [9,'SPTE'] (prefix names); V7 [8,'SPTEST01'] (whether 8 and 9 are treated alike); V8 [0x16,0xF5,0xFF] (event 112 or BLE API err 5 means type 0x16 is rejected). New two-parameter variants: V9 sp1=[3,0xF5,0xFF], sp2=[3,0x34,0x12]; V10 sp1=[3,0x34,0x12], sp2=[3,0xF5,0xFF]. Reading V9/V10: OR means both connect; sp2-ignored means V9 only; strict AND means neither. New 17th-byte check: V11 [7, U with its last byte changed]; connecting means the 17th element is not compared. New Config C: the 128-bit UUID U only in SCAN_RSP, the ADV packet carrying only flags + manufacturer data; run [7,U]. Event 100 proves active scanning using the one filter type already proven on a Race S. Repeat V5 and V6 with the name moved into the ADV packet (Config B) to separate name semantics from scan mode.
- T2, UltraBip on the Race S (within 5 min of power-on, XCTrack and BipLink closed; sp1 only unless V9/V10 showed OR). U1 [9, exact full-name UTF-8 bytes from T0]. U2 [9, 'UltraBip' as 8 ASCII bytes]: connects only if names prefix-match. U3 [3,0xE0,0xFF]: connects only if FFE0 is advertised in a packet the watch sees. U4 [8, full name]. After event 100: regUuid FFE0/FFE1 and enaCharNotf should yield event 106 with LK8EX1 bytes.
- T3, SensorPush HT.w on the Race S (phone app and any G1 gateway away): sp1 = whichever of [7,…]/[6,…] T0 showed, sp2 = the other. Expected: event 100 within a few seconds. Then regUuid the LED characteristic EF09000C-11D6-42BA-93B8-9DD7EC090AA9 and write [3] to blink it, which proves identity. Then write [1,0,0,0] to EF090080-…-0AA9, wait one tick, and readChar: event 102 with 4 bytes, int32 LE × 0.01 °C. If an HT.w connects in nRF Connect but not on the watch, suspect AD-type handling or a held connection, not the filter bytes.
- T4, RuuviTag on the Race S: sp1 [255,0x99,0x04] alone, then [255,0x99,0x04,0x05]. Expected: both connect if manufacturer data is prefix-matched. Only the first connects if just the company ID is compared. Neither connects only if the tag is not connectable (see T0) or manufacturer-data matching needs an exact length. After event 100, enable NUS TX notifications within 12 s, or the tag reboots.
- T5, active-scanning check on the user's own watch if no Android advertiser is available: [9,'ATC_xxxxxx'] against a pvvx LYWSD03MMC, whose firmware source puts the name only in SCAN_RSP. Event 100 means the watch scans actively. 'Cannot find device' together with a logged 'connect called' marker means passive scanning or broken name matching; T1 Config B/C separates the two.

## Report
# Adversarial re-check of the "ble-discovery" report

**Scope.** I re-opened the primary sources for the three most load-bearing claims, plus the Nuki and Tymewear evidence the report leans on:
1. Bosch / Race S / parameter semantics
2. SensorPush advertising-packet vs scan-response placement
3. Manufacturer-data filters (FORM + Ruuvi)

**Where things are.**
- My scratch copies are in `/tmp/deep-ble-discovery-verify/`: fresh fetches of every cited file, at pinned commits.
- I edited nothing in either project repo.

**Labels.**
- [confirmed]: primary source read by me
- [inferred]: my reasoning
- [corrected]: a claim in the original report that was wrong or overstated
- [unverified]: carried over and not re-checked, or not checkable

**Limit on forum coverage.** The forum search API returns `not-authorised` without a login. Forum coverage is therefore limited to topics fetched directly by id (15217) and the threads already cached in `/tmp/deep-ble-discovery/forum/`.

## Claim 1: Bosch bridge proves 128-bit filters, 17-element arrays and OR semantics on a Race S

### What I checked
- **Watch app.** `SellA/BoschEBikeSuunto` `ext1.js`. The arrays are unchanged since the initial commit 56a12ff (2026-05-11):
  - `[7, 228,204,219,226,42,42,180,129,233,17,162,234,32,235,0,0]`
  - `[6, same 16 bytes]`
  - That is 17 elements each.
  - The file's comment calls type 6 "solicitation". That is wrong: 0x06 is the incomplete 128-bit UUID list and 0x15 is 128-bit solicitation.
  - The author expects it to find "either the real bike or the bridge". That shows the author thinks of the two parameters as OR. But the bike is the central (it scans for solicitation), so it never advertises LDI, and [6] could never have matched anything.
- **Bridge firmware.** `SellA/BoschEBikeESP32` `src/main.cpp` at 23dc07d, committed 2026-05-14 19:02Z, 11 minutes before the forum post.
  - `startAdvertisingForSuunto` (around L466-488):
    - advertising payload `02 01 06 | 11 07 e4 cc db e2 2a 2a b4 81 e9 11 a2 ea 20 eb 00 00` (21 bytes)
    - `scanData.setName("BoschEBike")`
    - `setScanResponse(true)`, which gives a connectable, scannable ADV_IND
  - The header comment (L38-47) says the same.
  - After whitespace normalisation the function is byte-identical at 6de477c, efbbc3e, 23dc07d and 7dcc37a.
  - On master, `startAdvertisingForClient` uses the same payload when `MODE_SUUNTO_BRIDGE` is set (L789-806).
  - **No AD 0x06 exists in any version. [confirmed]**
- **Hardware report.** Forum 15217 #0 (pid 191370, 2026-05-14T19:13Z): the title says "on Suunto Race S", and the body says the author tested only on his own Race S. **[confirmed]**
  - The repository README instead lists "Suunto Vertical | Tested" and "Race / Race S | Compatible". The forum post is the primary source; the README is inconsistent with it.
  - `Knowledge.md` "Known Working Clients" lists "Suunto watch | 1 (Suunto Bridge) | Requires LDI UUID in AD". That is the author's own summary and does not by itself prove anything about advertising packet vs scan response.
- **Vendor template.** `templates/New-SuuntoPlus-BLE-Sport-App/ext1.js` (Editor 1.42.0):
  - It uses `[6, 0,15,…,1]` and `[7, 0,15,…,1]`, 17 elements each.
  - Its comment says it searches the UUID "from partial and complete lists (128 bit)".
  - The comment's list of types names 2-7 and 255 only.
- **Reference doc.** L2494-2495 says "max length 16 bytes". L2521 and L2640-2643 give the 0xFDF3 example: `[3,…]` "and also from partial list" `[2,…]`.

### Verdict
- **AD 0x07 in the advertising packet matches on a Race S: holds [confirmed].**
- **17 elements (type byte + 16) are accepted: holds [confirmed].** The vendor's own template uses that shape.
  - Not excluded: the firmware might truncate to 16 elements and prefix-match, which would also succeed. Test V11 below settles it.
- **[corrected] "The two parameters are alternatives (OR), strong evidence".** The Bosch result rules out only strict per-type AND. It is equally consistent with:
  - (a) OR;
  - (b) AND where 6/7 (and 2/3, 8/9) are treated as one family;
  - (c) the firmware ignoring sp2 entirely.
- Every public success has the matching filter in sp1: Bosch [7], FORM (sp1 only), Tymewear (name in sp1), and the doc example ([3] first). So **nothing observed distinguishes OR from "sp2 ignored"**.
- The vendor wording ("and also from partial list", "from partial and complete lists") makes OR the intended design [inferred], but it is untested.
- **What follows for design:** put the most likely matching filter in **sp1**, and make sp1 and sp2 equally specific. That is correct under all three readings. A fallback placed only in sp2 (Tymewear's UUID fallback, or any "backup" filter) may be dead code.

---

## Claim 2: SensorPush HT.w has the 128-bit UUID in the advertising packet and the name in the scan response

### What I checked
- **PR #19 itself.** `Bluetooth-Devices/sensorpush-ble` PR #19 "fix: parsing with passive scans" (merged 2023-02-07), read via `gh pr diff`:
  - It adds `SENSORPUSH_MANUFACTURER_DATA_LEN = {3: "HT.w", 5: "HTP.xw"}`.
  - It adds a fallback: when no name is present, classify by `"ef090000-11d6-42ba-93b8-9dd7ec090ab0" in service_uuids` plus the length of the manufacturer data.
  - It adds fixtures `HTW_DETECT_CHANGED_1/2`, with `name=""`, `service_uuids=["ef090000-…-0ab0"]`, `source="local"`, and about 30 rotating manufacturer-data keys, each 3 bytes.
- **Why that settles placement.** A passive scanner never receives scan-response data. The fix only works if the UUID is in the advertising packet. The empty name shows the name is not there. **[confirmed by construction of the fix]**
- **This supersedes `docs/research/critique.md` L174**, which said the fixtures prove only that the UUID is "advertised" somewhere.
- **Current source.**
  - `parser.py` L23-27 now also maps 2 bytes to TC.x.
  - `parser.py` L36-37 defines `SENSORPUSH_SERVICE_UUID_HT1 = …0aa9` and `SENSORPUSH_SERVICE_UUID_V2 = …0ab0`.
  - The test fixtures use the name "SensorPush HT.w 0CA1", which is 20 bytes (test_parser.py around L838, L898, L959).
- **sensorpush.com/bluetooth-api:**
  - The service is `EF090000-11D6-42BA-93B8-9DD7EC090AB0`.
  - **The characteristics end in `…EC090AA9`.**
  - The HT1 (1st generation) has no open protocol.

### Verdict
- **Holds (strong).** A 128-bit filter `[7, B0 0A 09 EC D7 9D B8 93 BA 42 D6 11 00 00 09 EF]` + `[6, same]` targets data in the advertising packet, so it does not depend on active scanning.
- **Still unknown:** whether the UUID is in AD 0x06 or 0x07. bleak merges the two. With both orders tried, this does not matter under OR or same-family AND, but it does matter if sp2 is ignored. In that case put whichever type T0 shows in sp1.
- **Additions:**
  - The filter only fits 2nd-generation units. An HT1 advertises `…0AA9` (per parser.py) and has no open protocol. Check the model before relying on it.
  - The characteristic UUIDs (EF090080, EF09000C, …) use the `…0AA9` base, not `…0AB0`. The project's `docs/ble_temperature/SPEC.md` L191-195 already gets this right.

## Claim 3: manufacturer-data filters match on the company ID; Ruuvi's 0x0499 is in the advertising packet

### FORM
- `zestuart/suunto-form` (one commit, b485512, 2026-07-21):
  - `ext1.js` is `appConn.connect(enabledZappId,evHandler,[255,125,6])`, sp1 only.
  - The README says "Status: Verified in open water on a **Suunto Vertical 2**".
- 0x067D is "Form Athletica Inc." in the SIG company list (cached `company_ids.yaml` L7491-7492).
- **[confirmed on a Vertical 2, not a Race S].**
- **[unverified] prefix matching.** I looked for FORM's actual advertisement and found nothing public:
  - `gh search code` for the FORM GATT base `8589-4d81-9803-a7a8ab3b0c06` finds only `garrickgan/formgoggles-py`.
  - That project finds the goggles by name or service-UUID prefix, never by manufacturer data (`form_sync.py` around L2191-2198).
- So it remains unknown how long FORM's manufacturer data is and whether it sits in the advertising packet or the scan response. FORM therefore proves company-ID matching but **not** prefix semantics, and **not** active or passive scanning.

### Ruuvi
Source read at the latest release, v3.34.1 (2025-05-20). The pinned drivers submodule is `0ce2494`.

- **Advertising mode.** `app_comms.c` `adv_init` (around L601-623) first sets `NONCONNECTABLE_NONSCANNABLE`.
  - `gatt_init` (around L628-647) then calls `rt_gatt_adv_enable()`.
  - That calls `rt_adv_connectability_set(true, name)` (`ruuvi_task_advertisement.c` L116-143), which sets `CONNECTABLE_SCANNABLE` and calls `ri_adv_scan_response_setup(name, nus_enabled)`.
- **Advertising packet.** In the drivers' `ruuvi_nrf5_sdk15_communication_ble_advertising.c`, `format_adv` (L377-429) builds flags plus manufacturer data with `company_identifier = m_manufacturer_id`.
  - `ruuvi_board_ruuvitag_b.h` L47 sets `RB_BLE_MANUFACTURER_ID 0x0499`.
  - When `m_include_service_uuid` is set, it also adds 0xFC98 (L115) as `uuids_more_available`, which is **AD 0x02**.
- **Scan response.** `format_scan_rsp` (L431-460) builds the full name plus NUS as `uuids_complete` (AD 0x07).
- **When 0xFC98 appears.** `app_dataformats.c` L93 at v3.34.1 calls `ri_adv_enable_uuid(nextState == DF_C5)`. Master L98 widens it to C5, 8 and 7. **Never for DF5. [confirmed]**
- **After a connection.** When a central connects, the advertising type drops to a non-connectable one (L183-192). Source-level confirmation of the one-central rule.
- **docs.ruuvi.com/communication/bluetooth-connection says:**
  - the scan response carries "Ruuvi XXXX" plus NUS;
  - the tag advertises connectable and scannable on the 1M PHY;
  - production firmware reboots if the central has not registered for NUS TX notifications within 12 s.
- **Verdict:** holds [confirmed].
- **Additions:**
  - **Connectability is a compile-time property.** `app_config.h` L297-299 sets `APP_GATT_ENABLED = RB_FLASH_SPACE_AVAILABLE > RB_FLASH_SPACE_SMALL`. ruuvitag_b is MEDIUM (GATT on). The `keijo` board is SMALL (GATT off), so a tag built for it never becomes connectable. [confirmed from source; which retail tag maps to which board is unverified]
  - Pre-check: nRF Connect must be able to connect to the user's tag and list NUS.
  - **[corrected] A 0xFC98 UUID filter is not usable:** `[3,0x98,0xFC]` never matches, and `[2,…]` matches only during DF_C5/8/7 frames.
  - **[corrected] The original recommendation paired sp1 `[255,0x99,0x04,0x05]` with sp2 = NUS `[7, 9E CA DC 24 …]`.**
    - NUS is a generic Nordic UART UUID that many unrelated devices advertise.
    - Under OR, that sp2 would let the watch connect to any NUS device in range. That violates the report's own design rule 3.
    - It also only works with active scanning.
    - Replace it with sp2 = `[255,0x99,0x04]`, or omit sp2.

## Things the investigator missed

### 1. [corrected] The Nuki failure says nothing about filter semantics
The commit timeline, from `gh api repos/slavikpi/nuki_suunto/commits`, all on 2026-06-20:

| Commit | Time (UTC) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| e7da13d | 19:54 | Adds on-watch crypto. `main.js` `onLoad` L597-598 calls `loadExt(3)()` and then `loadExt(4)()`. The `ext4.js` source is 26,735 B; the commit message gives 16.7 KB minified. |
| bca50c8 | 20:29 | First reported hardware failure, filter `[9,'Nuki']`+`[255, iBeacon prefix]`. Switches to the 255 filter alone. |
| eb95016 | 20:47 | The 255 filter alone also failed. Switches to `[8,'Nuki']`. |
| 7d56e26 | 20:59 | Reports that "Cannot find device" persisted across three structurally different filter attempts. |

- **The original report was wrong to say the `[8,'Nuki']` result was never reported.** The 7d56e26 message reports it as failing too.
- **The author's own diagnosis in 7d56e26:** the eager crypto load probably kept `onLoad` from completing, so `appConn.connect()` was never called.
- **The code supports that diagnosis:**
  - `state` is declared without an initializer (L67), so if `onLoad` throws, `evaluate`'s switch matches nothing.
  - `output.con` becomes non-zero only after event 100 (L449, L462).
  - The reference doc (L2485) says the Searching view closes only when `output.con` is non-zero.
- No later commit reports an outcome.
- **Separately,** `[8,'Nuki']` (short name) against a lock that advertises the complete name `Nuki_44793FEC` would fail under strict type matching anyway.
- **Consequences:**
  - Remove Nuki from every inference: name exact vs prefix, the manufacturer-data length rule, and the iBeacon hypothesis.
  - Design rule 7's "likely cause of the Nuki failure" is unsupported. The general caution against beacon-only payloads can stay, unattributed.
  - The real lesson for these apps is memory: lazy-load large ext files, as the reference recommends.

### 2. [corrected] Tymewear never had a working fallback
- Every version's `connect` uses the name filters whenever `expectedDeviceId` is truthy.
  - v1.0 (3a369ce, `Tymewear/Tymewear_Unofficial/main.js` L17) defaulted to `'87B4'`, apparently the author's own strap.
  - c305b4c changed the default to `'XXXX'`, with the commit message "Adjusted sensor ID to try to fix issue in Suunto app".
  - Current 7f9bab5 still has L17 `'XXXX'`, and `data.json` holds `device_id: "XXXX"`.
- Both defaults are truthy, so the 128-bit fallback (L170-187) is unreachable. The shipped app depends entirely on `[9,'TYME-'+id]`+`[8,…]` and the user's "Sensor ID" setting.
- Evidence that the name filter works stays circumstantial:
  - c305b4c added smoothed outputs "for use in Suunto app";
  - on 2026-09-15 the author added disconnect handling;
  - forum 13522 #5 says the app is installable.
- **[inferred], unchanged.** The `charCodeAt(i) & 0xFF` helper (L153-156) is confirmed. It is harmless for ASCII names.

### 3. Hardware tests had no way to settle the OR question
T1 tested only one parameter at a time. The test list below adds the missing variants:
- the sp1-match / sp2-garbage and sp1-garbage / sp2-match pair;
- a 17th-byte check;
- an active-scan check that uses a 128-bit UUID placed only in the scan response. The 128-bit type is the only one already proven on a Race S, so the name-matching unknown does not confound it.

### 4. Other filters that are broad in practice
- `[0x16,0x1A,0x18]` matches every ATC/pvvx-style sensor.
- `[0x16,0x95,0xFE]` matches every Xiaomi MiBeacon device.
- Under OR, using either as sp2 next to an exact name defeats the name. Put them in separate diagnostic builds, never in sp2.

---

## Claims I checked that still hold
- The simulator's `appConn` methods are empty no-ops (`webview-resources/main.js` L1030).
- `types.d.ts` L41 declares the parameters as `number[]` and the return type as `void`. The doc says connect returns a connectionId; that inconsistency is minor.
- 0xFDF3 is "Amersports" (SIG `member_uuids.yaml` L561-562, fresh from bitbucket).
- `thezenox/ble_fanet_sender` `src/main.cpp`:
  - L309 has the FFE0 `filterUuid` commented out as "not working, maybe service is not advertised";
  - L310 sets `useActiveScan(false)`;
  - L178-181 filters by address.
- pvvx `ATC_MiThermometer` `src/ble.c` (master, pushed 2026-09-23):
  - the advertising type is `ADV_TYPE_CONNECTABLE_UNDIRECTED` (L373-375);
  - `bls_ll_setScanRspData(ble_name)` (L368/L376);
  - `load_adv_data` (L602-623) copies the name into the advertising packet only when there is no beacon data or in Coded PHY mode.

## Not re-checked [unverified], carried over unchanged
- UltraBip name bytes and the vendor manuals.

## Corrected per-device recommendations

| Device | sp1 | sp2 | Confidence | Pre-check |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SensorPush HT.w (2nd gen) | `[7,B0,0A,09,EC,D7,9D,B8,93,BA,42,D6,11,00,00,09,EF]` | `[6, same]`. Swap the two if T0 shows AD 0x06. | Strong for the advertising-packet location; medium-high overall until tested on the watch | Name reads "SensorPush HT.w XXXX", not an HT1. Characteristics use the `…0AA9` base. |
| RuuviTag (ruuvitag_b firmware, DF5) | `[255,0x99,0x04,0x05]` | `[255,0x99,0x04]` or none. **[corrected] Not NUS.** | Strong for the advertising-packet location. Prefix matching beyond the company ID is unverified, so the `,0x05` byte may need dropping. | nRF Connect connects and lists NUS. Enable NUS TX within 12 s. |
| UltraBip / BlueBip | `[9, exact full UTF-8 name, 16 bytes]` | `[8, same]` | Low (unchanged) | T0 dump |
| pvvx LYWSD03MMC | `[9,'ATC_xxxxxx']` | none. **[corrected]** `[0x16,…]` only in a separate diagnostic build. | Low; depends on active scanning | — |
| Stock LYWSD03MMC | unknown | — | Unknown. **[corrected]** `[0x16,0x95,0xFE]` matches all MiBeacon devices, so diagnostic only. | — |

## Remaining unknowns, all needing hardware
- OR vs same-family AND vs sp2-ignored.
- Whether the 17th element is compared.
- Active vs passive scanning.
- Exact vs prefix vs contains matching for names and for manufacturer data beyond the company ID.
- Whether type 0x16 is accepted.
- The UltraBip's split between advertising packet and scan response.
- Scan timeout, and which device wins when several match.
